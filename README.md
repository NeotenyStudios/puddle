# The puddle engine
Hi, my name is NowL and welcome to the *puddle engine's* **github repository**
I'll be your guide to understand the project

### What is the puddle engine ?

Well it's pretty simple. Puddle is Neoteny Studios first engine.
Crafted with care, it's a mostly vanilla JS engine designed to support **2d multiplayer games**.
Or at least that's what **I strive to do**.

### When should it be finished ?

I would love to be able to say that puddle should be finished around July'ish, but we all know complex projects don't realy have a deadline.

### Documentation

Will come
Way to lazy right now
I swear
